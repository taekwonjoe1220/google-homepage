This project is to practice the basics of HTML & CSS.

Specific Goals:

1. Use inspect to grab background/font colors.
2. Find image URLs in existing websites
3. Center elements horizontally
4. Stick divs to top or bottom of a page
5. Use appropriate CSS selectors to copy a page's styles
6. Practice making git commits and using command line to update project in GitHub
7. Outline & track my process here in this README as well as in comments of project files

Project Outline / Tracking Progress

1. Create & Link HTMl/CSS files <!-- Done -->
2. Reset base styling (padding, margin, box-sizing) <!-- Done -->
3. Use Inspect Element to grab font-family, font colors, and background color
4. Work Top Down on adding elements
   a. About, Store, Gmail, Images, etc. Line (Header) <!-- Done -->
   b. Google Image <!-- Done -->
   c. Search bar & buttons <!-- Done -->
   d. Footer <!-- Done -->

What went well:

1. Revisiting HTML structure
2. Centering using Flex
3. Overall look and final product (static)
4. Getting a lot fast in terminal to open project, git flow is clicking

Things to do better next time:

1. Read the entire directions (spent too much time inspecting web page and copying styles vs. trying on my own)
2. Add media queries to give responsiveness
3. Find a better way to push footer to bottom than position: absolute <!-- Use flexbox and align to bottom? Test later -->
